            The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca, sometimes panda bear or simply panda) is a bear species endemic to China.
            It is characterised by its bold black-and-white coat and rotund body. 
            The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid. 
            Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet.
            Giant pandas in the wild occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion. 
            In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas 
            along with specially prepared food.
